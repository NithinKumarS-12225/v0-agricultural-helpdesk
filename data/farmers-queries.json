      "category": "cultivation",
      "solution": "Rice is typically planted during the monsoon season (June to August) in most parts of India. The ideal soil temperature should be 20-30°C. For transplanting, seedlings aged 30-40 days are best. In southern regions, two crops can be grown annually - summer rice and winter rice. Consult local agricultural department for region-specific timing.",

      "solution": "Cotton requires 40-50 irrigations during the growing season depending on rainfall and soil type. Total water requirement is 750-1000 mm. Critical irrigation stages are: flowering and boll formation. Use drip irrigation to save 30-40% water. Monitor soil moisture and avoid waterlogging. In rainfed areas, mulching helps retain moisture.",

      "solution": "Sugarcane requires balanced nutrition: Nitrogen (N): 150-200 kg/ha, Phosphorus (P): 50-75 kg/ha, Potassium (K): 50-100 kg/ha. Use split applications of nitrogen in 3-4 doses. Add FYM 20-25 tons/ha before planting. Use vinasse or press mud as organic amendment. Foliar spray of micronutrients (Zn, B) improves yield. Consult soil test report for region-specific recommendations.",

      "category": "harvesting",
      "solution": "Harvest maize when: 1) Grain moisture content reaches 20-25%, 2) Kernels become hard and shiny, 3) 30-40 days after silking. Test moisture by pressing kernel with thumbnail - if thumbnail enters but doesn't puncture, it's ready. Timely harvest prevents grain loss and ensures better quality. Allow 1-2 days for field drying before mechanical harvesting.",

Benefits: Saves 30-60% water compared to flood irrigation, reduces weed growth by 50%, minimizes fertilizer runoff, improves crop yield by 20-30%, suitable for various crops and terrains. Cost: ₹40,000-60,000 per hectare for installation. Government subsidy available in many states (30-50% of cost). ROI achieved in 2-3 years.",
